\chapter*{Abstract}
\thispagestyle{empty}
This work describes the development of the first open-source VHDL
frontend named Yodl. Yodl uses the synthesis toolkit Yosys as the
foundation.

First of all, the state-of-the-art of digital hardware design is
described. Furthermore, some details of the Yosys toolkit are
shown. After that, this work illustrates general, compiler-specific
problems any translation system faces during implementation. Then, the
thesis elaborates on the problems relevant to the processing of VHDL
code and shows the appropriate algorithms and design decisions the
project uses. Finally, this work provides a glance into the possible
future of Yodl where, among other things, current limitations and
improvements of the test system play an important role.

This thesis documents and explains the source code of Yodl which was
developed in the scope of this master thesis and also represents the
greatest achievement of it.

Both, the written part and the source code, might be of interest for
hardware developers, VHDL programmers, Yosys users, and theorists with
a background on compiler construction or formal languages. For
theoreticians, especially the practical aspects of this thesis are
likely to be relevant.
